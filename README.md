###### What I know is that I don't know anything, so I keep looking for the truth/answers and realize how little I actually know, but the more I keep looking for the truth the more I know that I have a chance to be saved!

###### One thing if for sure, this has taught me how to put my ego to the side

## THE EARTH IS FLAT, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW, NASA LIES!

**ISAIAH 40:22:** It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:

**ISAIAH 40:23:** That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.

**ISAIAH 40:24:** Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

## Praised be Jesus Christ name! Praise Jesus for the Flat Earth Truth! Amen.
